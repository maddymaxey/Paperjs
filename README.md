This is the Paper.js library wrapped to use with Meteor apps. Clone the repo and add it to a packages folder in your apps directory. 


When you run the meteor server, you will get errors. I've found that the library works beautifully when  attached to a function. 

You need a copy of the gitignore file outside of the main package file in the main directory of your meteor app.
